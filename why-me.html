			<h1>Alex Couch - Why Me?</h1>
			<p>
				You should hire me because I will get the job done. I do things in a different way. I will do what the client wants me to do in my own creative way. I like to fix bugs and errors and when I can't I will just move on to something else. I am always learning new things. I am very intelligent and I know what I am doing. I am going to college to study more and better in computer science at Eastern Washington University.
