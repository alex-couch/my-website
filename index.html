			<h1>Alex Couch - Who Am I?</h1>
			<p>My name is Alex Couch and I am an 18 year old guy with a passion of programming and computer science. I start programming when he was 14 years old using a really basic language called <b>Blitz</b>. I took a liking to programming and went on to look for more ways to do it but better. I found <b>Java</b> and I started making mods for <b>Minecraft</b>. I spent about a year learning <b>Java</b> and <b>Minecraft mods</b>. When I was 15, only a freshman in high school, I took a class on web design. I took a liking to this too but I wasn't quite enjoying it as much. When I was 16 years old, a sophomore, I continued to make <b>Minecraft mods</b> and I continued to learn <b>Java</b>. I enjoyed the <b>C-style</b> structure that Java had. I learned all about computers and I continued to study the hardware, the inner works of the hardware, how programs work on hardware, and how I can do it all myself. I started to pursue a career in computer science. I loved the field and I even took a semester at <b><a href="http://www.ktectraining.org">KTEC</a></b> in Computer Repair and learned even more about computers. There I met some professional coders and they helped me get into a program called <b><a href="http://www.3strandcode.com">3-Strand-Code</a></b>. This program helped me become a better programmer and a better web designer. I started to take more interest in web design and I started to build websites for people, starting with my <a href="http://www.patriciaeaston.com">grandmother</a>. I finished it and started doing business with her and it was my first launched website that I started and completed. I felt great about because all my life I never really had a very good habit with projects. I was diagnosed in late 2015 with <b>Bipolar I disorder</b>, a mood disorder affecting the way I function on a daily basis. It got to the point I couldn't work on anything or focus on anything. My school work hit an all time low and my GPA went down below 1.5 and I started failing classes and isolating myself. I started on medications after a hospitalization in late October of 2015 and started seeing a psychiatrist. My manic episodes have been stable since March of 2016 and my depressive episodes has been more maintained. I am now able to complete projects successfully and computer programming has helped me with that. I now know <b>HTML, CSS, jQuery, Java, Sass, and JavaScript</b>.
